**This week I shipped a persistent AI memory tool and a Knowledge Graph MCP server.**  

Details:

mcp-knowledge-graph
 → A local knowledge graph memory server for MCP. Persistent, file-backed context so your AI doesn’t forget after a restart.

ai-github-actions
 → GitHub Actions that auto-update your AI’s knowledge graph—summarize, link insights, keep memory alive.

Groundwork for persistent AI identity running on your own terms. 

More soon.
