This section documents enhancements to the project that involve capabilities extending beyond the visible scope of local environment.

These events are marked as **⧉ECI** — *External Capability Invoked* — where tools, systems, or workflows have been brought in to augment function, precision, or reach.

This page is experimental. It will evolve as my understanding of those capabilities expands.

→ See `.eci_log.md` in the repo root for a running record of examples.
